> Burst out of your filter bubble

Burst is a chrome extension that uses deep learning to scan through the tweets you see and warn you about and overly emotional or hateful ones, so you know which posts to take with a grain of salt. It shows you the emotion and strength of the emotion of each tweet. Also, it shows tweets as misleading if they contain outdated information or information taken out of context.
